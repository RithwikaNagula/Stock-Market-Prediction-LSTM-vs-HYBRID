Stock Price Prediction: LSTM vs Hybrid (LSTM + XGBoost)

This project compares the performance of a pure LSTM model versus a hybrid model that combines LSTM for feature extraction and XGBoost for final prediction. It focuses on forecasting stock prices and generating a 30-day future outlook based on historical data.


Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of the market. In this project, we:
- Use an LSTM neural network to learn time-series dependencies.
- Extract LSTM outputs as features.
- Use XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, to improve accuracy and capture nonlinear relationships.
- Perform 30-day future predictions for stock prices.

Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)
- XGBoost
- Streamlit (for UI, if applicable)
